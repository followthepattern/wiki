# Error Handling

In the Go (Golang) programming language, errors are not treated as exceptions, and there is no concept of exception throwing.

## Error Interface
Error handling is accomplished through the use of the error interface. The occurrence of an error does not necessarily lead to the immediate termination of the program. In contrast to some other languages, where attempting to open a non-existent file would trigger an exception, causing the application to throw an error and terminate if the exception is not caught, Go handles this differently. In Go, such an action does not result in a fatal error; instead, an error object is returned, allowing the developer to decide how to respond to the situation.

The `error` interface is used for organizing, propagating, and handling errors.

Its implementation looks like this:

```go copy
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

From the code snippet above, you can see that the types are used for error handling must have a function named `Error`, which returns a `string`. This function will provide the error message.

```go copy
type CustomError struct {
    Msg string
}

func (e CustomError) Error() string {
    return e.Msg
}

func main() {
    var Error error
    Error = CustomError{"error"}
  
    log.Fatal(Error)
}
```

`CustomError` is a correct implementation of the `error` interface so it can be assigned to the `Error` variable, which type is `error` interface.

## Built in error functions

### `errors.New`

The `errors.New` function creates a simple error with a static message. It’s part of the standard `errors` package.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	err := errors.New("something went wrong")
	fmt.Println(err)
}
```

Run this code in your [browser](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/T0uZBnbex3L) without installation.

Use `errors.New` for simple, static error messages where no dynamic data is needed.

### `fmt.Errorf`

The `fmt.Errorf` function provides more flexibility by allowing formatted error messages, including dynamic values. It’s part of the `fmt` package.

```go copy
func Errorf(format string, a ...interface{}) error
```

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	userID := 42
	err := fmt.Errorf("user with ID %d not found", userID)
	fmt.Println(err)
}
```
Use `fmt.Errorf` when you need dynamic error messages or want to include contextual information.

### `errors.As`
The `errors.As` function is used to **check if an error or any error in its chain matches a specific type**. This is particularly useful when you need to handle custom error types.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

type CustomError struct {
	Msg string
}

func (e *CustomError) Error() string {
	return e.Msg
}

func main() {
	err := &CustomError{"Something went wrong"}
	var target *CustomError

	if errors.As(err, &target) {
		fmt.Println("Custom error detected:", target.Msg)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Unknown error")
	}
}
```

### `errors.Is`
The `errors.Is` function is used to **check if an error is equal to a specific error**, including any error in the chain. It works well for error comparisons where you care about equivalence rather than type.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")

func main() {
	wrappedErr := fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", ErrNotFound)

	if errors.Is(wrappedErr, ErrNotFound) {
		fmt.Println("The error is 'not found'")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Different error")
	}
}
```

### `errors.Wrap`

The `errors.Wrap` function (from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package) is used to **add context to an error while preserving the original error for later inspection**. Although Go 1.13 introduced `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping, `errors.Wrap` remains popular in some projects.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/pkg/errors"
)

func main() {
	err := errors.New("database connection failed")
	wrappedErr := errors.Wrap(err, "unable to load user data")

	fmt.Println(wrappedErr) // Prints: unable to load user data: database connection failed
}
```

Run the code above in your [browser](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/iVcie0Yr35b)

For Go 1.13+ projects, you can achieve similar wrapping with `fmt.Errorf`:
```go
wrappedErr := fmt.Errorf("unable to load user data: %w", err)
```
