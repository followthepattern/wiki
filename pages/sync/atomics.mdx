# Atomics in Go

**Atomics** in Go are low-level synchronization primitives provided by the `sync/atomic` package. They allow developers to perform operations on shared variables safely without using more complex synchronization mechanisms like locks.
Atomic operations ensure that a particular operation on a shared variable is performed as a single, indivisible action.
This eliminates race conditions without the need for locks, making atomic operations faster and more lightweight than traditional synchronization techniques.

## Common Atomic Operations in Go

The `sync/atomic` package provides functions for common atomic operations on integers, unsigned integers, and pointers.

### Load
Reads the value of an atomic variable safely.

```go copy {10}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64 = 42
	value := atomic.LoadInt64(&counter)
	fmt.Println("Loaded value:", value)
}
```

### Store
Writes a value to an atomic variable safely.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64
	atomic.StoreInt64(&counter, 100)
	fmt.Println("Stored value:", counter)
}
```

 

### Add
Performs an atomic addition operation, returning the new value.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64
	atomic.AddInt64(&counter, 5)
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			atomic.AddInt64(&counter, int64(i))
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("After addition:", counter)
}
```

### Compare and Swap (CAS)
Atomically compares the current value of a variable to an expected value and swaps it with a new value if they match. CAS is a foundational operation for building higher-level synchronization primitives.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64 = 42

	swapped := atomic.CompareAndSwapInt64(&counter, 42, 100)
	fmt.Println("Swapped:", swapped, "New value:", counter) // Swapped: true New value: 100

	swapped = atomic.CompareAndSwapInt64(&counter, 50, 200)
	fmt.Println("Swapped:", swapped, "New value:", counter) // Swapped: false New value: 100
}
```

### Swap
Atomically replaces the current value with a new one and returns the old value.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64 = 10
	oldValue := atomic.SwapInt64(&counter, 20)
	fmt.Println("Old value:", oldValue, "New value:", counter)
}
```

## Atomic Operations on Pointers

In addition to integers, Goâ€™s `sync/atomic` package provides functions for atomic operations on pointers. These functions are useful for safely updating references in concurrent programs.


```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var pointer unsafe.Pointer
	data := "Hello, Atomic!"
	atomic.StorePointer(&pointer, unsafe.Pointer(&data))

	loaded := atomic.LoadPointer(&pointer)
	fmt.Println("Loaded value:", *(*string)(loaded))
}
```
