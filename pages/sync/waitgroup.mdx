# WaitGroup

In concurrent programs, there are situations where you need to wait for the results of multiple independently running processes. In the context of Golang, this often means waiting for multiple **goroutines** to finish. For a single process, you can simply use a "done" **channel**, such as `context.Done`. However, the `sync.WaitGroup` provides an excellent solution for coordinating numerous goroutines.

Essentially, `sync.WaitGroup` is a **concurrent safe** counter that you can use to track how many goroutines have been created and how many have completed.

`WaitGroup` has three important methods. The `Add` method increments the counter by an integer, `Done` decrements the counter by one, and `Wait` blocks the calling thread until the `WaitGroup` counter reaches zero.

Here's a simple example where an anonymous function is executed within a goroutine, and the main thread waits for its completion using `WaitGroup`. The `wg` variable is incremented by calling the `Add` function, which is then decremented by one using `Done`, it gets called, when the goroutine completes.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("Hello Follow The Pattern")
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		wg.Done()
	}()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Program finished!")
}
```

You can run the above example [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/x1JvuUbM3bO?v=goprev).

The previous simple example can also be solved using channels, but the following code demonstrates a scenario, which a `WaitGroup` can solve easier, where numerous goroutines need to be coordinated simultaneously. You need to ensure proper maintenance of the `WaitGroup` counter by calling `Done` at the right place.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var wait sync.WaitGroup

	numberOfRoutines := 5
	wait.Add(numberOfRoutines)

	for i := 0; i < numberOfRoutines; i++ {
		go func(ID int) {
			fmt.Printf("ID:%d: Hello FP routine!\n", ID)
			wait.Done()
		}(i)
	}
	wait.Wait()
}
```

You can run the above example [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/fftXa_Y6Hkc?v=goprev).

The `ID` values may not necessarily be printed in ascending order because the invocation of goroutines does not necessarily happen in the same order as the command to create the goroutine.

In the following code snippet, the `Wait` method is not called, so it won't block the main goroutine, which may result unfinished processes.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("Hello Follow The Pattern")
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		wg.Done()
	}()
	// wg.Wait() won't block the main thread
	fmt.Println("Program finished!")
}
```

You can run the above example [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/o0ULBLRWaUA?v=goprev).

The following program will result in an error message: *"all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!"* because the `Done` method is not called within the anonymous function, and the `Wait` method waits indefinitely until the counter reaches zero.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("Hello Follow The Pattern")
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		// wg.Done() 
	}()
	wg.Wait() // deadlock!
	fmt.Println("Program finished!")
}
```
