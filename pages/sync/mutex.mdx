# Mutex

In a concurrent application, you may encounter the problem of multiple processess try to modify a variable at the exact same time. This can lead to incorrect behavior, and the phenomenon is known as a **race condition**.

You can use `sync.Mutex` to lock a variable that multiple goroutines want to modify concurrently, preventing other goroutine from accessing it for a short period to ensure the modification happens safely. After the necessary changes, you can release the lock, allowing other concurrently running processes to access it again.

While this approach is widely used in other languages, Go recommends using **channels** for synchronization. However, in some cases, using a **Mutex** can be simpler. A prime example is implementing a **Counter**, which you can see in practise below:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Counter struct {
	sync.Mutex
	value int
}

func main() {
	counter := Counter{}
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go func(i int) {
			counter.Lock()
			counter.value++
			defer counter.Unlock()
		}(i)
	}
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	counter.Lock()
	defer counter.Unlock()

	fmt.Println("counter", counter.value)
}
```

You can run the above example [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/RzkGyvSaRUp?v=goprev).

In the example above, the `Counter` type embeds the `sync.Mutex` type, which allows the `counter` variable to have `Lock` and `Unlock` methods. These methods help block modifications by other goroutines while one goroutine is making changes.

Inside a loop, multiple goroutines are executed, each calling anonymous functions that increment the counter's value by one. Before incrementing the value, the `Lock` method locks the `counter` object from other goroutine, and after the value is incremented, the `Unlock` method releases the lock. Finally, the program prints the value on the main goroutine.

## Read - Write mutex

RWMutex allows multiple concurrent readers, but only one writer at a time.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type SafeData struct {
	value int
	mu    sync.RWMutex
}

func (s *SafeData) Read() int {
	s.mu.RLock()
	defer s.mu.RUnlock()
	return s.value
}

func (s *SafeData) Write(val int) {
	s.mu.Lock()
	defer s.mu.Unlock()
	s.value = val
}

func main() {
	data := SafeData{}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Writer goroutine
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
			data.Write(i)
			fmt.Println("Written:", i)
			time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}()

	// Reader goroutines
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(id int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			for j := 0; j < 5; j++ {
				val := data.Read()
				fmt.Printf("Reader %d read: %d\n", id, val)
				time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
			}
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```
