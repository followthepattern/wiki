# Primitive Types
The Go programming language features a variety of primitive types, often referred to as predeclared types. Similar types can be found in other languages, such as `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, and `string`.



## Boolean
The boolean type, which takes logical values, has only two possible values: `true` and `false`. For instance, conditions in `if` and `for` statements are logical values, and the `==` and `<` comparison operators also yield logical values.

| Type | Description | Default Value | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| `bool` | boolean type | `false` | isVisible := true



## Numeric Types
Go provides several numeric data types for programmers to work with, allowing storage of integers and floating-point numbers of varying sizes and precision, facilitating flexible handling of numeric data.

| Type | Description | Default Value | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| `int` | integer of at least 32 bits | `0` | index := 1
| `int8` | 8-bit integer | `0` | var index int8 = 127
| `int16` | 16-bit integer | `0` | var index int16 = 32767
| `int32` | 32-bit integer | `0` | var index int32 = 2147483647
| `int64` | 64-bit integer | `0` | var index int64 = 9223372036854775807
| `uint` | unsigned integer of at least 32 bits | `0` | index := 1
| `uint8` | 8-bit unsigned integer | `0` | var index uint8 = 255
| `uint16` | 16-bit unsigned integer | `0` | var index uint16 = 65535
| `uint32` | 32-bit unsigned integer | `0` | var index uint32 = 4294967295
| `uint64` | 64-bit unsigned integer | `0` | var index uint64 = 18446744073709551615
| `byte` | alias for `uint8`, fully equivalent | `0` | var index byte = 255
| `float32` | 32-bit floating-point number | `0` | var index float32 = -342.3439
| `float64` | 64-bit floating-point number | `0` | var index float64 = -342.3439
| `complex64` | complex number, equivalent to two `float32` values | `(0+0i)` | index := complex(32.3, 18.9)
| `complex128` | complex number, equivalent to two `float64` values | `(0+0i)` | index := complex(128.2323823, 1238.2829932)



## String

In Go, a `string` is fundamentally a sequence of bytes. When string literals are used in Go, they are encoded using the UTF-8 character encoding system by default. Each Unicode code point represents a unique character or symbol, which can be a single letter, digit, punctuation, or even an emoji. In Go, code points are represented using the `rune` type, which is an alias for the `int32` type.

Since a `string` is a sequence of consecutive characters, you have the ability to access individual characters using `rune` values. It's important to note that, similar to the `string` type, `rune` values in Go are also immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they're created.

| Type | Description | Default Value | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| `rune` | alias for `uint32`, fully equivalent | `0` | var index rune = 4294967295
| `string` | character string type, convertible to `[]byte` | `""` | text := "hello"



Using special characters in Go
```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	str := "A😊" // UTF-8 encoding: "A" is 1 byte, "😊" is 4 bytes.

	// Length of the string in bytes
	fmt.Println("String length (in bytes):", len(str)) // Output: 5 (1 byte for "A" + 4 bytes for "😊")

	// Size of a byte
	var b byte = 'A'
	fmt.Println("Size of byte:", unsafe.Sizeof(b)) // Output: 1

	// Size of a rune
	var r rune = '😊'
	fmt.Println("Size of rune:", unsafe.Sizeof(r)) // Output: 4

	// Convert string to runes
	runes := []rune(str)
	fmt.Println("Rune array length:", len(runes)) // Output: 2 (1 rune for "A", 1 rune for "😊")

	// Total memory for rune array
	fmt.Println("Memory for rune array:", len(runes)*int(unsafe.Sizeof(runes[0]))) // Output: 8
}
```


## Constants

Constants are expressions assigned with specific values. These are evaluated at compile time, not at runtime. To declare a constant, one assigns a value to a name using the const keyword. The fixed nature of their values ensures they cannot be accidentally reassigned during runtime.



## Literals
In Go, literals are the constant values assigned directly in the code. They are used to represent fixed values of various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, or complex types. Literals are essential for defining values during initialization and for simple calculations.

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var dec = 42       // Decimal
    var oct = 075      // Octal
    var hex = 0x1A3F   // Hexadecimal
    var bin = 0b1010   // Binary

    fmt.Println(dec, oct, hex, bin)
}
```


## Special Type
`uintptr` is an **unsigned integer type** in Go that is used to store the memory address of an object. It is primarily used for **low-level memory operations** and is often associated with working with the Go runtime, operating system calls, or interacting with unsafe pointers.


### Example: Using `uintptr` with the `unsafe` Package

```go copy {13,18}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	// Example array
	array := [3]int{10, 20, 30}

	// Get a pointer to the first element
	ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&array[0])

	// Convert to uintptr and manipulate the memory address
	for i := 0; i < len(array); i++ {
		// Use uintptr to calculate the address of the next element
		elementPtr := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(i)*unsafe.Sizeof(array[0])))

		// Print the value at the calculated address
		fmt.Println(*elementPtr)
	}
}
```
