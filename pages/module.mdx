# Module

A module is a collection of multiple Go packages that are built together. Typically, a Go repository contains a single module, located at the root of the repository. The module that contains the packages also has a `go.mod` file, which defines the module path. The module path acts as a prefix when referencing packages. Additionally, the `go.mod` file specifies the module's dependencies on other modules, their minimum version numbers, and the minimum Go version required to build the module.
