# Gomega

Gomega is a matcher and assertion library that helps you write test cases in a clear and understandable manner.

[Official Documentation](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/)

The goal is to write test cases that are easily comprehensible to everyone. Gomega's API is so well-designed that sometimes assertions can be read as if they were English sentences.

In the following, I try to list the most used assertion functions and giving examples to it

## Equal

```go copy {12}
package mypackage

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
    "testing"
)

func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterTestingT(t)

    result := MyFunction()
    Expect(result).To(Equal("expected result"))
}
```
In the following sections, I will try to list couple of commonly used assertion functions and provide examples for them.

## Error


In Go, when we encounter an error, we don't throw an error like in other languages. Instead, we return it.
It is a common pattern in the language for functions to have two return types: one for the value and the other for the error.

To verify if the error is nil, we can use Gomega in the following way:

```go copy {21}
package main

import (
	"errors"
	. "github.com/onsi/gomega"
	"testing"
)

func mightReturnError(condition bool) (string, error) {
	if condition {
		return "", errors.New("an error occurred")
	}
	return "success", nil
}

func TestErrorCheck(t *testing.T) {
	RegisterFailHandler(ginkgo.Fail)

	result, err := mightReturnError(false)

	Expect(err).Should(BeNil())
	Expect(result).Should(Equal("success"))
}
```

In this example, the `mightReturnError` function returns an error if the condition is true.
In the test `TestErrorCheck`, we use Gomega to assert that `err` is `nil` and `result` is equal to `"success"` when the condition is false."

> Notice, that you can use `Should` keyword instead of  `To`. It will improve the reading!

### Using Succeed with error assertion
It is possible to make the assertion more readable by using `Succeed` matcher along with `Should`.

```go copy {20}
package main

import (
	"errors"
	. "github.com/onsi/gomega"
	"testing"
)

func mightReturnError(condition bool) (string, error) {
	if condition {
		return "", errors.New("an error occurred")
	}
	return "success", nil
}

func TestErrorCheck(t *testing.T) {
	RegisterFailHandler(ginkgo.Fail)

	result, err := mightReturnError(false)
	Expect(err).Should(Succeed())
	Expect(result).To(Equal("success"))
}

```
In this example, Should(Succeed()) is used to assert that err is nil, indicating that the function call was successful.
