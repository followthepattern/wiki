# Testing in Go

Go has built-in support for testing, making it easy to write, organize, and execute tests. The standard `testing` package provides everything you need for unit testing, benchmarks, and examples. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to test Go code effectively, covering basic tests, table-driven testing, mocking, and best practices.

## Basics of Testing in Go

### Creating a Test File
Test files are named with the `_test.go` suffix. If the source file is `math.go`, the test file should be `math_test.go`.

### Writing a Basic Test
Each test function should start with `Test` preffix and it should take a single parameter of type `*testing.T`.

```go
package main

import "testing"

func Add(a, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
	result := Add(2, 3)
	expected := 5

	if result != expected {
		t.Errorf("Add(2, 3) = %d; want %d", result, expected)
	}
}
```

Run the code in your [browser](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/mZNb0eB0AlZ), without installation.

Execute the following command for running the tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Testing for Errors

Functions that return errors should be tested to ensure correct error handling.

```go
func Divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
	if b == 0 {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("division by zero")
	}
	return a / b, nil
}

func TestDivide(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		a, b        int
		expected    int
		expectError bool
	}{
		{10, 2, 5, false},
		{10, 0, 0, true},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		result, err := Divide(tt.a, tt.b)
		if tt.expectError {
			if err == nil {
				t.Errorf("expected error but got none")
			}
		} else {
			if err != nil {
				t.Errorf("unexpected error: %v", err)
			}
			if result != tt.expected {
				t.Errorf("Divide(%d, %d) = %d; want %d", tt.a, tt.b, result, tt.expected)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Mocking in Go

Mocking is useful for testing interactions with external systems like APIs or databases. Use interfaces to abstract dependencies and create mock implementations for testing.

```go copy {12,18}
type DataFetcher interface {
	FetchData() (string, error)
}

func GetData(fetcher DataFetcher) (string, error) {
	return fetcher.FetchData()
}

// Mock implementation
type MockFetcher struct{}

func (m MockFetcher) FetchData() (string, error) {
	return "mocked data", nil
}

func TestGetData(t *testing.T) {
	mock := MockFetcher{}
	data, err := GetData(mock)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
	}
	if data != "mocked data" {
		t.Errorf("expected 'mocked data', got %s", data)
	}
}
```

## Benchmarks in Go

Benchmarking allows you to measure the performance of functions. Benchmark functions start with `Benchmark` and take a `*testing.B` parameter.

```go
func BenchmarkAdd(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		Add(2, 3)
	}
}
```

Run benchmarks:
```bash
go test -bench=.
```

---

## Examples in Go

Go allows you to write example functions that serve as documentation and can also be executed as tests.

```go
func ExampleAdd() {
	fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))
	// Output: 5
}
```

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed when your tests run. In Go, the `go test` command provides built-in support for measuring and reporting test coverage, making it easier to ensure your tests cover critical parts of your codebase.

To measure test coverage in Go, use the `-cover` flag with the `go test` command:

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

**Output**
```
ok  	myapp	0.005s	coverage: 85.0% of statements
```

This output indicates that 85% of your code statements were executed during the tests.

### Generate Detailed Coverage Reports

For more detailed insights, use the `-coverprofile` flag to generate a coverage report

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

The `coverage.out` file contains detailed information about which lines were covered.

You can then visualize this report in the terminal or as an HTML file.

### Terminal Visualization
```bash
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

**Output**
```
myapp/main.go:34:	Add		100.0%
myapp/util.go:12:	Multiply	85.7%
total:			(statements)	90.0%
```

### HTML Visualization
```bash
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

This opens an interactive HTML report in your default browser, highlighting covered and uncovered code lines.
