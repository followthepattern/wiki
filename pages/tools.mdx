### Golang Lint CI
Below is a basic example of a golangci-lint configuration file (.golangci.yml) that you can use as a starting point for your Go project.
This setup includes commonly used linters while keeping the configuration simple and clean.
```yaml
# .golangci.yml
run:
  timeout: 5m
  tests: true # Run linters on test files

linters-settings:
  govet:
    check-shadowing: true

  gocyclo:
    min-complexity: 10 # Minimum complexity to report

  ineffassign: # Detects assignments to variables that are never used
    enabled: true

  staticcheck:
    checks:
      - all

  revive:
    severity: warning # Define custom severity for revive

linters:
  enable:
    - govet         # Reports suspicious constructs
    - staticcheck   # Advanced static analysis
    - gocyclo       # Reports high complexity functions
    - gofmt         # Checks for gofmt issues
    - ineffassign   # Detects ineffective assignments
    - revive        # Replacement for golint
  disable:
    - errcheck      # Disable if you find it too verbose
    - typecheck     # Disable type checking if it's already done elsewhere

issues:
  exclude-rules:
    - path: ".*_test.go" # Exclude rules for test files
      linters:
        - gocyclo
  max-issues-per-linter: 50
  max-same-issues: 3

output:
  format: colored-line-number
  print-issued-lines: true
```
