# Composite Types
In Go, **composite types** are types that are created by combining one or more other types.

## Array
An array in Go is a fixed-size sequence of elements, all of the same type. When declaring an array, you must specify its size.

General syntax
```go copy
list := [int]Type{}
```
Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`, as it's not possible to assign the `nil` value of another type.

When defining an array, you must always specify the length of the data sequence.
```go copy
array := [3]int{}
```

The `array` has a length value, which can be accessed as follows; if the default value is set, the length will be 0.

```go copy
length := len(array)
```
Additionally, individual elements can be accessed using indexing.

```go copy
item := array[1]
```

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// define an array with default value(s)
	array := [3]int{0}

	// you can give or override values using indexes
	array[1] = 1

	array[2] = 2

	length := len(array)

	fmt.Printf("length: %d, array: %v", length, array)
}
```
You can run the above code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/FfBdl1XUdTE).

If the length of the data sequence isn't defined, it won't create an `array` type, but rather a `slice`.

## Slice
A slice in Go is a dynamic array that can store elements of the same type. It can be indexed and its length queried, much like a fixed-size array. Unlike arrays, slices can grow or shrink as needed. When the capacity is exceeded, a new underlying array is allocated, and the data is transferred.

General syntax
```go copy
list := []Type{}
```
Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`.

Here's how you can create a `slice` type:
```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

func main() {
	// similar to defining an array, except without a predefined length
	slice1 := []int{1, 2}
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(slice1).Kind().String()) // slice

	array := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} // array

	// creating from array
	var slice2 []int = array[1:4]

	// creating by using make with a length of 5
	slice3 := make([]int, 5)

	slice3[4] = 1

	// using make and defining capacity allocates an underlying array
	// of size 10 and returns a slice of length 0 and capacity 10
	slice4 := make([]int, 0, 10)

	// slice4[0] = 1 // would panic, the slice has a 0 length

	fmt.Println("slice1", slice1)
	fmt.Println("slice2", slice2)
	fmt.Println("slice3", slice3)
	fmt.Println("slice4", slice4)
}
```
You can run the above code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/VWLo-LqMXcS).

Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`, as it's not possible to assign the `nil` value of another type.

```go copy
length := len(array)
```
The default length will be zero.

Individual elements can be accessed using indexing, similar to an `array`.

```go copy
item := slice[1]
```

### Adding an Item to a `nil` Slice in Go

In Go, a `nil` slice is a slice that has been declared but not initialized with any values. Despite being `nil`, you can still use the built-in `append` function to add items to it. When you append an item to a `nil` slice, Go automatically allocates memory for the slice and adds the item to it. As a result, the slice will no longer be `nil` and will have a length of 1.

Here's an example to demonstrate this behavior:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var list []int = nil // Declare a nil slice of int

	list = append(list, 1) // Append an item to the nil slice

	fmt.Println(list) // Output: [1]
}
```

In this example, `list` is initially a `nil` slice.
After appending the integer `1` to it, the slice becomes `[1]` with a length of 1.
This demonstrates that the `append` function can handle `nil` slices gracefully, making it easy to work with slices that may not be initialized at the time of declaration.

## Map

In the Go programming language, a `map` is an implementation of a hash table.

General syntax:
```go copy
map[KeyType]ValueType
```

Where `KeyType` is a comparable type, as later it will be used to retrieve an element from the data structure based on its value. Meanwhile, `ValueType` can be any type, including another `map`.

Its default value is `nil` or a `nil map`, as it's not possible to assign any other type's `nil` value.

There are several ways to initialize a map:

```go copy
var m map[string]int = map[string]int{}
```

```go copy
m := map[string]int{}
```

```go copy
m := make(map[string]int)
```

Assigning a value after initialization is straightforward:

```go copy
m["follow"] = 2022
```

Value assignment during initialization:

```go copy
m := map[string]int {
	"follow": 1,
	"the": 2,
	"pattern": 3,
}
```

Reading from a map can also be done in several ways:

```go copy
value := m["follow"]
```

If there is no value associated with the key, the `map` returns the default value of the value type. In such cases, it is better to use the following approach:

```go copy
value, ok := m["follow"]
```

The boolean variable `ok` indicates whether the `map` contains the requested key, while `value` contains the stored value.

The built-in `delete` function can be used with a `map` to easily remove an element:

```go copy
delete(m, "follow")
```

The `len` function can be used to determine how many key-value pairs have been registered:

```go copy
len(m)
```

## Struct
A `struct` is a collection of fields of different types that logically belong together, that creates a new type. It's not a reference type, which means, when a `struct` passed to a function it will be copied. `struct`'s fields will hold their default values until it gets defined.

General syntax:
```go copy
type [NAME] struct {
	[FIELD NAME] [FIELD TYPE] [TAGS...]
}
```
Here's an example of creating a `struct`:
```go copy
type Vertex struct {
	X int `json:"x"`
  Y int `json:"y"`
	Z int `json:"z"`
}
```
The above syntax can be further simplified if tags are not defined:
```go copy
type Vertex struct {
	X, Y, Z int
}
```
Fields' values can be modified later:
```go copy
v := Vertex{
	X: 1,
	Y: 2,
	Z: 3,
}

v.X = 3
fmt.Println(v)
```
Pointers to the `struct` can also be created using the `&` operator:
```go copy
v := Vertex{
	X: 1,
	Y: 2,
	Z: 3,
}

p := &v

fmt.Println(p)
```
A new variable from a `struct` can be created in various ways:
```go copy
fmt.Println(Vertex{1, 2, 3})
fmt.Println(Vertex{X: 1})
fmt.Println(Vertex{Y: 2, Z: 3})

// pointer
fmt.Println(&Vertex{1, 2, 3})
```
For accessing different fields or modifying them, you can use the `.` character. This also works with pointers, but you need to check that the pointer is not `nil` before reading it.

```go copy
v := Vertex{
	X: 1,
	Y: 2,
	Z: 3,
}

fmt.Println(v.X)

p := &v
fmt.Println(p.X)
```

### Struct Embedding
struct embedding is a mechanism that allows you to compose or embed one struct type within another. It allows you to achieve code reuse and create more complex data structures by building on existing ones.

The fields and methods of the embedded struct become part of the embedding struct. This enables you to access the embedded struct's fields and methods as if they were directly defined in the embedding struct.

```go copy
type Base struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

func (b *Base) GetName() string {
	return b.Name
}

type Log struct {
	CreationID int
	UpdateID   int
}

func (l *Log) GetCreationID() int {
	return l.CreationID
}

func (l *Log) GetUpdateID() int {
	return l.UpdateID
}

type User struct {
	Base
	Log
}
```
It's important to note that, with type embedding, the methods of the embedded type become methods of the outer type, but when invoked, the receiver will be the inner type, not the outer type. So the `User` type will directly have the `GetName` function because it embeds the `Base` type. When the `GetName` method is called, the receiver will be the `Base` type, not the `User` type. Unless the `User` type overrides.

It's possible to shadow methods of the inner type to access them using the receiver of the outer type.

```go copy
func (u *User) GetName() string {
    return u.Base.Name
}
```
When creating an instance of the outer type, you can set the values of the inner types:
```go copy
func NewUser(name string, creationID int) User {
	return User{
		Base{Name: name},
		Log{CreationID: creationID},
	}
}
```
But this is not mandatory; Otherwise the fields will take their default values.
```go copy
func NewUser(name string, creationID int) User {
	return User{}
}
```

Embedded types introduce naming conflicts, but these can be resolved easily. The fields or methods of the outer type always shadow those of the inner type. Additionally, the name of the embedded can't be the same to the field name of the enclosing type at the same level.

```go copy
type User struct {
	Log
	Log Logger
}
```

Without the ability to embed types, you would need to write enclosing functions around the fields, just like in the below example, which would increase the lines of code without substantially improving functionality.

```go copy
type User struct {
	base Base
	log  Log
}

func (u *User) GetName() string {
	return u.base.Name
}
```

### Anonymous Struct

In Go, an *anonymous* `struct` is a `struct` type that can be defined without a name, without even using the `type` keyword. It can be created directly in a variable declaration or function call.

In the following code snippet, a variable named `point` receives an anonymous `struct` object with two integer fields, `x` and `y`. Afterward, the value of the `x` field is modified just as it would be with a regular named `struct`.

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	point := struct {
		x, y int
	}{
		x: 10,
		y: 20,
	}

	fmt.Println(point)

	point.x = 30

	fmt.Println(point)
}
```

You can run the above code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/uyt3bTDxP-1).

In the next example, a traditional named `struct` and an anonymous `struct` are compared. Both have identical field names and values. The comparison evaluates to true.

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

type Point struct {
	x, y int
}

func main() {
	point := struct {
		x, y int
	}{
		x: 10,
		y: 20,
	}

	p2 := Point{
		x: 10,
		y: 20,
	}

	fmt.Println(point == p2) // true
}
```
