# Map

In the Go programming language, a `map` is an implementation of a hash table.

General syntax:
```go copy
map[KeyType]ValueType
```

Where `KeyType` is a comparable type, as later it will be used to retrieve an element from the data structure based on its value. Meanwhile, `ValueType` can be any type, including another `map`.

Its default value is `nil` or a `nil map`, as it's not possible to assign any other type's `nil` value.

There are several ways to initialize a map:

```go copy
var m map[string]int = map[string]int{}
```

```go copy
m := map[string]int{}
```

```go copy
m := make(map[string]int)
```

Assigning a value after initialization is straightforward:

```go copy
m["follow"] = 2022
```

Value assignment during initialization:

```go copy
m := map[string]int {
	"follow": 1,
	"the": 2,
	"pattern": 3,
}
```

Reading from a map can also be done in several ways:

```go copy
value := m["follow"]
```

If there is no value associated with the key, the `map` returns the default value of the value type. In such cases, it is better to use the following approach:

```go copy
value, ok := m["follow"]
```

The boolean variable `ok` indicates whether the `map` contains the requested key, while `value` contains the stored value.

The built-in `delete` function can be used with a `map` to easily remove an element:

```go copy
delete(m, "follow")
```

The `len` function can be used to determine how many key-value pairs have been registered:

```go copy
len(m)
```

## Clone a map using built-in `maps` library

Following example demonstrates the usage of the `maps` package to clone a map, which is a higher-level approach compared to manually copying each key-value pair.

The `maps.Clone` function calls later `clone` function from the runtime package.

```go copy {13}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"maps"
)

func main() {
	map1 := map[string]int{
		"key": 1,
	}

	map2 := maps.Clone(map1)
	map2["key"] = 100

	fmt.Println("map1", map1["key"])
	fmt.Println("map2", map2["key"])
}
```

## Delete elements from a `map` using `maps.DeleteFunc`

Following example illustrates how to use the maps package to perform a conditional deletion of key-value pairs from a map.
You can specify a specific criterion based on the key or the value.

```go copy {17}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"maps"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	m := map[string]int{
		"prefix_value1": 1,
		"value2":        2,
		"value3":        3,
		"prefix_value4": 4,
	}

	maps.DeleteFunc(m, func(k string, v int) bool {
		return strings.HasPrefix(k, "prefix")
	})
	fmt.Println(m)
}
```
In this example, you can see `DeleteFunc` deletes only specific prefixed key-value pairs from the map.

## Comparing maps with custom equality function

The code snippet below demonstrates the use of maps package to compare two maps of different types (int and string) based on a custom equality function. 

```go copy {19}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"maps"
)

func main() {
	m1 := map[string]int{
		"one":   1,
		"two":   2,
		"three": 3,
	}
	m2 := map[string]string{
		"one":   "1",
		"two":   "2",
		"three": "3",
	}
	eq := maps.EqualFunc(m1, m2, func(v1 int, v2 string) bool {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%d", v1) == v2
	})
	fmt.Println(eq)
}
```

`maps.EqualFunc` is part of the maps package and is designed to determine if two maps are equal based on a custom function provided by the user.
