# Slice
A slice in Go is a dynamic array that can store elements of the same type. It can be indexed and its length queried, much like a fixed-size array. Unlike arrays, slices can grow or shrink as needed. When the capacity is exceeded, a new underlying array is allocated, and the data is transferred.

General syntax
```go copy
list := []Type{}
```
Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`.

Here's how you can create a `slice` type:
```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

func main() {
	// similar to defining an array, except without a predefined length
	slice1 := []int{1, 2}
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(slice1).Kind().String()) // slice

	array := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} // array

	// creating from array
	var slice2 []int = array[1:4]

	// creating by using make with a length of 5
	slice3 := make([]int, 5)

	slice3[4] = 1

	// using make and defining capacity allocates an underlying array
	// of size 10 and returns a slice of length 0 and capacity 10
	slice4 := make([]int, 0, 10)

	// slice4[0] = 1 // would panic, the slice has a 0 length

	fmt.Println("slice1", slice1)
	fmt.Println("slice2", slice2)
	fmt.Println("slice3", slice3)
	fmt.Println("slice4", slice4)
}
```
You can run the above code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/VWLo-LqMXcS).

Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`, as it's not possible to assign the `nil` value of another type.

```go copy
length := len(array)
```
The default length will be zero.

Individual elements can be accessed using indexing, similar to an `array`.

```go copy
item := slice[1]
```

## Adding an Item to a `nil` Slice in Go

In Go, a `nil` slice is a slice that has been declared but not initialized with any values. Despite being `nil`, you can still use the built-in `append` function to add items to it. When you append an item to a `nil` slice, Go automatically allocates memory for the slice and adds the item to it. As a result, the slice will no longer be `nil` and will have a length of 1.

Here's an example to demonstrate this behavior:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var list []int = nil // Declare a nil slice of int

	list = append(list, 1) // Append an item to the nil slice

	fmt.Println(list) // Output: [1]
}
```

In this example, `list` is initially a `nil` slice.
After appending the integer `1` to it, the slice becomes `[1]` with a length of 1.
This demonstrates that the `append` function can handle `nil` slices gracefully, making it easy to work with slices that may not be initialized at the time of declaration.
