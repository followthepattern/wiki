# Array
An array in Go is a fixed-size sequence of elements, all of the same type. When declaring an array, you must specify its size.

General syntax
```go copy
list := [int]Type{}
```
Its default value is `nil` or a `nil slice`, as it's not possible to assign the `nil` value of another type.

When defining an array, you must always specify the length of the data sequence.
```go copy
array := [3]int{}
```

The `array` has a length value, which can be accessed as follows; if the default value is set, the length will be 0.

```go copy
length := len(array)
```
Additionally, individual elements can be accessed using indexing.

```go copy
item := array[1]
```

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// define an array with default value(s)
	array := [3]int{0}

	// you can give or override values using indexes
	array[1] = 1

	array[2] = 2

	length := len(array)

	fmt.Printf("length: %d, array: %v", length, array)
}
```
You can run the above code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/FfBdl1XUdTE).

If the length of the data sequence isn't defined, it won't create an `array` type, but rather a `slice`.
