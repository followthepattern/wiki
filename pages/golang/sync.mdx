# Sync Package

In Golang, the `sync package` contains primitive synchronization elements for writing concurrent programs. It offers various structures to coordinate the execution of **goroutines**, safely manage shared resources, and facilitate communication between goroutines. These include:

- [WaitGroup](/golang/waitgroup)
- [Mutex](/golang/mutex)
- RWMutex
- Once

These types should be used when the specific problem is **much more difficult** to solve using channels.
