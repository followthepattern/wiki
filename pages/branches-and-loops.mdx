# Branches

In Golang, there are several methods for implementing branches to control the flow of program execution.

## if
The most common method is the `if` statement, which evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if that condition is `true`

```go copy
if condition {
    // code, runs only if the condition is true
}
```

Any condition that ultimately evaluates to a boolean value can be used in a condition:
```go copy
if 2 > 1 {
    fmt.Println("Hello Follow The Pattern!")
}
```

## if ... else
This extends the previous case by allowing you to specify code in the *else* branch that will run only if the condition fails. The syntax is:

```go copy
if condition {
    // code, runs only if the condition is true
} else {
    // code, runs only if the condition is false
}
```

In the following example, the `value` pointer is checked; if it's not `nil`, the value is printed, otherwise, the program terminates with an error:
```go copy
var value *int

if value != nil {
    fmt.Println(*value)
} else {
    log.Fatal("value is empty")
}
```

## if ... else if ... else
When multiple true branches are necessary in the condition, this form is one of the choices for handling it. The syntax looks like this:

```go copy
if condition1 {
    // code, runs only if the first condition is true
} else if condition2 {
    // code, runs only if the second condition is true
} else {
    // code, runs only if none of the conditions are true
}
```

Here is an example of using multiple branches. This piece of code notifies the user if their balance is zero or below:

```go copy
balance := 0

if balance < 0 {
    fmt.Println("Balance is below 0, add funds now or you will be charged a penalty.")
} else if balance == 0 {
    fmt.Println("Balance is equal to 0, add funds soon.")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Your balance is greater than 0.")
}
```

## if with assignment
The combination of assignment and `if` can be simplified using this syntax element, which binds the variable's reference to the block.

```go copy
if value, ok := os.LookupEnv("LOG_LEVEL"); ok {
    // value and ok are declared and attached to this condition
} else if value == "DEBUG" {
    // and to all the branches
} else {
    fmt.Printf("LOG_LEVEL has an unexpected value: \"%s\"", value)
}
```

## switch ... case
This language element is also used for handling multiple logical branches, resulting in more readable and concise code. The syntax:

```go copy
today := time.Now()

switch expression {
case value1:
    // code, runs only if the value is equal to the expression
case value2:
    // code, runs only if the value is equal to the expression
...
...
default:
    // code, runs only if none of the above is equal to the expression, this branch is not mandatory
}
```

The following example shows a piece of code that outputs the name of the day if it's a weekday. If no match is found, the `default` branch will run, indicating it's the weekend:
```go copy
today := time.Now()

switch today.Weekday() {
case time.Monday:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
case time.Tuesday:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")
case time.Wednesday:
    fmt.Println("Wednesday")
case time.Thursday:
    fmt.Println("Thursday")
case time.Friday:
    fmt.Println("Friday")
default:
    fmt.Println("Weekend!")
}
```

If no `default` branch is provided and none of the conditions are true, execution will exit the `switch` code block.

```go copy
today := time.Now()

switch today.Weekday() {
case time.Monday:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
case time.Tuesday:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")
}
```

## switch ... case with assignment
Similar to the `if` case, you can use abbreviated assignment in conjunction with the `switch` block.

```go copy
switch today := time.Now().Weekday(); today {
case time.Monday:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
case time.Tuesday:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")
case time.Wednesday:
    fmt.Println("Wednesday")
case time.Thursday:
    fmt.Println("Thursday")
case time.Friday:
    fmt.Println("Friday")
default:
    fmt.Println("Weekend!")
}
```

This language feature can save you few line of code. The variable created within the `switch` block cannot be used outside of that block.

## switch ... case without condition
It's not mandatory to define a condition when creating a `switch` block. In this case, the conditions following the `case` keyword will be evaluated based on whether they're true or false, determining which branch the assignment will continue on.

```go copy
balance := 0

switch {
case balance < 0:
    fmt.Println("Balance is below 0, add funds now or you will be charged a penalty.")
case balance == 0:
    fmt.Println("Balance is equal to 0, add funds soon.")
default:
    fmt.Println("Your balance is greater than 0.")
}
```

# Loops
Loops are language features that allow a code block to be executed multiple times, preventing unnecessary code duplication. Several types of loops are available in Golang:
 - Three-component loop
 - *while*-like loop
 - Infinite loop
 - *For-each* loop

## Three-component loop
This is the classic implementation of a loop, consisting of three parts. The first part is a statement that is executed only once before the loop. The second part is a condition that controls when the looping will stop. The third part is also a statement that is executed after each iteration. Syntax:

```go copy
for first statement; condition; post statement {
    // code, runs until the condition is true
}
```

A short example:
```go copy
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

Iterating over a list:
```go copy
list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
for i := 0; i < len(list); i++ {
    fmt.Println(list[i])
}
```

Using the `continue` keyword allows you to skip certain iterations of the loop. In the following example, only the values with odd indices are printed:
```go copy
list := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
for i := 0; i < len(list); i++ {
    if i%2 == 0 {
        continue
    }
    fmt.Println(list[i])
}
```

By using the `break` keyword, you can exit loop before it would finish. The next snippet demonstrates a simple search algorithm that prints whether the searched expression exists in a list:
```go copy
filter := "apple"

list := []string{"banana", "apple", "orange"}

found := false

for i := 0; i < len(list); i++ {
    if list[i] == filter {
        found = true
        break
    }
}

fmt.Println("Does it contain apple?", found)
```

## *While*-like loop
In other languages, this would be a separate language feature. In Golang, we can use the `for` keyword to condition-based loops as well. Essentially, you omit the first and third statements from the previous example. The syntax is:

```go copy
for condition {
    // code, runs until the condition is true
}
```

A simple example:
```go copy
n := 1
for n < 5 {
    n *= 2
    fmt.Println(n)
}
```

## Infinite loop
This without a condition and statements, meaning it will run infinitely.

```go copy
for {
    // code, runs infinite times
}
```

Implementation example:
```go copy
for {
    fmt.Println("Follow The Pattern")
    if rand.Int()%2 == 0 {
        break
    }
}
```

To prevent the program from running indefinitely, a condition must be placed within the loop. If the condition is true, the `break` will exit the loop. Otherwise, the loop would run indefinitely.

## *For-each* loop
This type simplifies iteration over a list, automatically managing indexing for you.

```go copy
for [INDEX OF THE CURRENT ITEM], [VALUE OF THE CURRENT ITEM] := range [LIST] {
    // code, runs on each item of the list
}
```

```go copy
list := []string{"Follow", "The", "Pattern"}

for index, value := range list {
    fmt.Println(index, value)
}
```
