# `net` package

The `net` package implements various network I/O interfaces, such as TCP/IP.

[official doc](https://pkg.go.dev/net)

In the following code snippet, you can find an example of running a small web service using the `net/http` package. You can gain a deeper understanding of this package by following the Go courses provided by Follow The Pattern:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello Follow The Pattern!")
	})
	fmt.Println("Server running!")

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil))
}
```
