# `sync` package

[official docs](https://pkg.go.dev/sync)

The `sync` package implements basic synchronization primitives such as `Once`, `WaitGroup`, and `Mutex`. When developing higher-level synchronization, it's recommended to use `channel` types.

Concurrency, parallelism, and synchronization are complex topics. The code snippets below provide brief examples of the primitives provided by Go, but for a deeper understanding, consider the [Go courses](https://followthepattern.net/) offered by Follow The Pattern.

Here's a simple example of using `WaitGroup`:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("Follow The Pattern makes your learning effective!")
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		wg.Done() // subtracts 1 from the WaitGroup counter
	}()
	wg.Wait() // waits for the WaitGroup counter to become zero
	fmt.Println("Program finished!")
}
```



Here's an example demonstrating the use of `sync.Mutex`:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	type Counter struct {
		sync.Mutex
		value int
	}

	counter := Counter{}
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go func(i int) {
			counter.Lock() // lock the counter to modify it safely
			counter.value++
			defer counter.Unlock() // unlock the counter
		}(i)
	}
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	counter.Lock() // lock the counter to print its value
	defer counter.Unlock() // unlock the counter when the execution is finished

	fmt.Println("Counter:", counter.value)
}
```
