# `context` package

The `context` package defines the `Context` type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.

This package introduces the `Context` type, which can carry variables related to a specific request, expiration times, or signals for indicating the completion of execution.

By associating values with the `Context` type, it is easy to express whether a specific call has a successful authentication.

[official doc](https://pkg.go.dev/context)

The following example demonstrates how to add a variable to the `Context` variable that stores information about the logged-in user:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	type ContextKey string

	user := struct {
		Name string
	}{
		Name: "John",
	}

	userContextKey := ContextKey("User")
	ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), userContextKey, user)

	if v := ctx.Value(userContextKey); v != nil {
		fmt.Println("Found value:", v)
		return
	}
}
```

A `Context` variable can be created along with a `cancel` function, which can be used to signal the termination of a request:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// The cancel function will cancel the context
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("Waiting for context cancellation in the goroutine...")
		<-ctx.Done() // The function continues as soon as the context is cancelled
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second) // The main goroutine sleeps for a second
	fmt.Println("Cancelling the context")
	cancel() // Cancels the context
}
```

You can run the code snippet above [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/HRZyohQMawu).

The `Context` type can also be used to define deadlines, signaling the termination of a call:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	deadline := time.Now().Add(time.Second * 1)
	ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(ctx, deadline)

	// The ctx will be expired, but it is a good practice to call its
	// cancellation function in any case to avoid keeping its parent alive longer than necessary.
	defer cancel()

	fmt.Println("Waiting for the deadline")
	// Blocks until it receives a value
	// from the context's channel
	<-ctx.Done()
	fmt.Println(ctx.Err())
}
```

You can run the code snippet above [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/dzWcQ9NkeWk).

A `Context` variable can also be created with a predefined timeout value, which signals the termination of a call. The difference from the previous example is that you specify a time interval rather than a specific time:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Second*1) // Sets the timeout to 1 second
	defer cancel()

	select {
	case <-time.After(10 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Overslept")
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println(ctx.Err()) // Prints "context deadline exceeded"
	}
}
```
