# IO package

The `io` package provides basic interfaces for I/O primitives, such as reading and writing interfaces. Since these are low-level implementations, they are not inherently safe for concurrent execution.

[official docs](https://pkg.go.dev/io)

## Example of using `io.Reader`



```go copy
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// io.Reader implements the standard Read method
	var reader io.Reader = strings.NewReader("Follow The Pattern makes learning efficient!")
	b, err := io.ReadAll(reader)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(b))

	stringBuilder := strings.Builder{}

	// io.Writer implements the standard Write method
	var writer io.Writer = &stringBuilder

	fmt.Fprint(writer, "Follow The Pattern")

	fmt.Println(stringBuilder.String())
}
```
