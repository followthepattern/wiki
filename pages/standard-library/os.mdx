# `os` package

The `os` package contains platform-independent functions for interacting with operating system functionalities. The following code snippets provide a few simple examples of using environment variables.

[official docs](https://pkg.go.dev/os)

## Reading Environment Variables

While there are many libraries available for reading environment variables or combining configuration values with environment variables, including managing overrides, there may be cases where you prefer not to download an extra module or include non-built-in modules at all.

In such scenarios, you can utilize the built-in `os` package in Go.

Here's an example of how to use the `os` package to read and set environment variables:

```go copy {15,19}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Reading an environment variable by key
	path := os.Getenv("PATH")
	fmt.Println("PATH:", path)

	// Setting environment variables by key
	os.Setenv("DB_USERNAME", "my_db_username")
	os.Setenv("DB_PASSWORD", "my_secret_db_password")

	// Retrieving and printing environment variables
	dbUsername := os.Getenv("DB_USERNAME")
	fmt.Println("DB_USERNAME:", dbUsername)

	// Getting the executable path
	executablePath, err := os.Executable()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Printing the executable path
	fmt.Println("Executable Path:", executablePath)
}
```

In this example:

- `os.Getenv("PATH")` is used to read the `PATH` environment variable.
- `os.Setenv("DB_USERNAME", "my_db_username")` and `os.Setenv("DB_PASSWORD", "my_secret_db_password")` are used to set the `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables, respectively.
- `os.Executable()` is used to get the path of the current executable. This can be useful for determining the directory of your application when it's running.

Using the `os` package provides a straightforward way to work with environment variables without the need for external dependencies.

## File Operations in Go

Creating, reading, and writing files are common tasks in application development, especially for CLI (Command Line Interface) programs.

Golang provides various levels of abstraction to manage file operations. In this section, we focus on methods that are both user-friendly and efficient.

### Creating a File

Creating a file in Go is straightforward. The `os` package includes a function named `Create`, which is used to create a file. The file path can be either absolute or relative. The function returns a tuple: an `os.File` object, which contains metadata about the created file, and an `error`, which captures any failures that may occur.

Below is a typical example of using the `os.Create` function:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	_, err := os.Create("./dump.txt") // Create a new file
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
		os.Exit(1) // Exit the application while printing the error
	}
}
```

Run the code [here](https://goplay.followthepattern.net/snippet/PVrTq5Gshin).

### Reading from a File

The simplest way to read the contents of a file into a variable is by using the `os.ReadFile` function. This function reads the entire file content into a string variable and also returns an `error` to capture the reason for any failures.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	entireFile, err := os.ReadFile("file.txt") // Assuming 'file.txt' is the intended file path
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	fmt.Println(entireFile)
}
```

### Reading File Content into a Binary Array

The following example demonstrates a lower-level implementation of file reading. The `Read` function fills a byte array with data from the file, allowing you to specify the length of the array.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("./dump.txt") // Open file
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
		os.Exit(1) // Exit if file can't be opened
	}

	data := make([]byte, 50)
	count, err := file.Read(data) // Read from the file
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
		os.Exit(1) // Exit if reading fails
	}

	text := data[:count]
	fmt.Printf("count: %d characters: %q string: %s", count, text, text) // Print the file content
}
```

In this example, the application opens a file named `dump.txt` and reads its content into a byte slice named `data`. Note that the length and capacity of the slice are limited to 50, meaning it will read only the first 50 characters into the `data` byte array.

## Checking if a File Exists

This approach is arguably the most readable way to check if a file exists in Go. While there are other methods to verify the existence of a file, this one stands out for its clarity.

```go copy {11}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	filename := "file.txt"

	if _, err := os.Stat(filename); os.IsNotExist(err) {
		fmt.Printf("File %s does not exist.\n", filename)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("File %s exists.\n", filename)
	}
}
```

In this example, `os.Stat` is used to retrieve the file's status. If the file does not exist, `os.Stat` returns an error that satisfies `os.IsNotExist`, indicating the absence of the file.
