## Standard library

The Go standard library is a curated collection of packages that complement the language, making it faster and more efficient to use. Standard library packages are part of the default Go installation, so there is no need to install them separately. This collection provides solutions to common problems, such as file reading and writing, standard input/output handling, string conversion, template handling, and concurrency management. After installing the Go package, it will be available in the `/usr/local/go/src` directory.

You can access its source code on [GitHub here](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src).
