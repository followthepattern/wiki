# Interface

In Go (Golang) programming language, an interface is a collection of method signatures with a unique name. You cannot create instances of interfaces, but you can assign values of types that implement the methods defined in the interface. The default value for an interface is `nil` or `nil interface` because you cannot assign any other type's `nil` to it.

**General Syntax**

```go copy
type [INTERFACE NAME] interface {
    [METHOD NAME] ([ARGUMENTS...]) ([RETURN TYPES...])
    // ...
}
```

One of the most popular interfaces in Go is the `error` interface, which is used for organizing, passing, and handling errors.

## Defining an Interface
An interface definition essentially describes what behavior it expects from a type. In the example below, the `Shape` interface expects an `Area` function with no parameters and `float64` return type.

```go copy
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}
```

Any type can be assigned to the `Shape` interface as long as it correctly implements the `Area` method.

In the following complete example, you can see the `Database` interface and the implementing `PSQL` type. The `Database` interface expects three methods, which the `PSQL` type satisfies.

The usage of these types is demonstrated in the `main` function. It shows that you can create various database APIs that implements the `Database` interface, allowing the caller to interact with them in a uniform way. This decouples the `PSQL` type from the calling code. Moreover, during testing, you can "mock" the interface, making it suitable for unit testing.

```go copy
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

type Database interface {
    Connect() error
    Query(query string) ([]byte, error)
    Close() error
}

type PSQL struct {
    // implementation details
}

func (m *PSQL) Connect() error {
    fmt.Println("Connecting to PSQL database...")
    return nil
}

func (m *PSQL) Query(query string) ([]byte, error) {
    fmt.Printf("Executing query \"%s\" on PSQL database...\n", query)
    return []byte("result"), nil
}

func (m *PSQL) Close() error {
    fmt.Println("Closing PSQL database connection...")
    return nil
}

func main() {
    db := &PSQL{}
    err := db.Connect()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error connecting to database:", err)
        return
    }

    defer db.Close()

    result, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM users")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error executing query:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Result:", string(result))
}
```

## Anonymous Interface

An anonymous interface is an **inline interface declaration** that specifies a set of methods that a type must implement.
Unlike named interfaces, which are reusable and declared explicitly, anonymous interfaces are declared inline and are typically used for one-off situations.

Hereâ€™s an example of a function accepting an anonymous interface:

```go copy {5}
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(v interface {
	String() string
}) {
	fmt.Println(v.String())
}

type MyType struct {
	Value string
}

func (m MyType) String() string {
	return m.Value
}

func main() {
	data := MyType{Value: "Hello, Go!"}
	printValue(data) // "Hello, Go!"
}
```

### Use Cases

1. **Single-Use Contracts**:
   - When you need to enforce a specific behavior without defining a reusable interface.

2. **Testing and Mocks**:
   - Anonymous interfaces can be used to quickly define expectations for mock objects in test scenarios.

3. **Dynamic Function Parameters**:
   - Functions can accept anonymous interfaces for highly specific behavior without  the codebase with named interfaces.

### Anonymous Interfaces vs. Named Interfaces

| Feature                  | Anonymous Interface          | Named Interface              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Reusability**          | Cannot be reused elsewhere.  | Can be reused across code.   |
| **Readability**          | Compact but can be less readable. | Explicit and self-documenting. |
| **Usage Scope**          | Best for single-use scenarios. | Ideal for shared contracts.  |

## Empty Interface
The empty interface, denoted as `interface{}`, is a special interface that doesn't specify any method signatures. It allows you to assign values of any type to it. In a sense, you can think of every type as implicitly implementing the empty interface. There is a built-in alias for empty interface, called `any`.

You can use the empty interface to work around Go's strong typing when necessary.

```go copy
func printValue(obj any) {
    fmt.Println(obj)
}

func main() {
    printValue(42)
    printValue("Hello, World!")
    printValue([]int{1, 2, 3})
}
```

In the above example, the `printValue` function takes an empty interface as a parameter, allowing you to pass values of different types to it.

### Type assertion
Type assertion in Golang is a mechanism used to extract the underlying value of an interface variable. It's commonly used when you have a variable of interface type and you need to retrieve its dynamic value.

#### Comma-ok idiom
When you use `value, ok := obj.(Type)`, if the assertion is true, `ok` becomes true and value gets the underlying value. If the assertion is false, `ok` becomes false and value gets the zero value of the asserted type.

This is a safe way to perform type assertion.

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
	Name string
}

func (u User) GetName() string {
	return u.Name
}

func main() {
	var obj interface{} = User{Name: "Alex"}

	if u, ok := obj.(interface{ GetName() string }); ok {
		fmt.Println(u.GetName())
	} else {
		fmt.Println("given object doesn't implement GetName() method")
	}
}
```

#### Unsafe type assertion

```go copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var obj interface{}

	value := obj.(string)

	fmt.Println("Value", value)
}
```
The code directly asserts `obj` as a `string` without checking if it's actually of that type. Since `obj` is an empty interface and hasn't been assigned any value, this assertion is incorrect.
