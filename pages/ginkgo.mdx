# Testing with Ginkgo

Ginkgo is a testing framework written in Go programming language using *Behaviour Driven Development* approach.

To learn more about Ginkgo check out the [docs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)

## Writing a simple unit test for verifying a method

This example below shows how you can use Gingko with testing `FullName` method of the given `User` struct

```go copy {2, 9}
var _ = Describe("Users", func() {
  It("can retrieve with a user full name", func() {
    user := &users.User{
      FirstName: "Brandie",
      LastName: "Monday",
      Age: 38,
    }

    Expect(user.FullName()).Should(Equal("Brandie Monday"))
  })
})
```

## Using container nodes to organizing testcases
The following example uses multiple container nodes to organize tests. The containers are `Describe`, `Context`, `BeforeEach` and `It`.
`Describe` and `Context` gives a context for running tests on functionailties of the given entity.
Using containers allows you to structure your actions and share variables that you only create on those containers where it will be used. 

While `It` behaves as a leaf node that tries to exercise your code and verify it. `BeforeEach` will run as many times as `It` node described in the defined context.
Top level `BeforeEach` will run just before every `It` execution.

```go {4,12,17}
var _ = Describe("User Model", func() {
	var user models.User

	BeforeEach(func() {
		user = models.User{
			Name:  "John Doe",
			Email: "johndoe@example.com",
			Age:   30,
		}
	})

	Context("when the user is initialized", func() {
		It("should have a name", func() {
			Expect(user.Name).To(Equal("John Doe"))
		})

		It("should have an email", func() {
			Expect(user.Email).To(Equal("johndoe@example.com"))
		})

		It("should have an age", func() {
			Expect(user.Age).To(BeNumerically(">", 0))
		})
	})
})
```
