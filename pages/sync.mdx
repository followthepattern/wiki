# Sync Package

In Golang, the `sync package` contains primitive synchronization elements for writing concurrent programs. It offers various structures to coordinate the execution of **goroutines**, safely manage shared resources, and facilitate communication between goroutines. These include:

- [WaitGroup](/sync/waitgroup)
- [Mutex](/sync/mutex)
- [Atomics](/sync/atomics)

These types should be used when the specific problem is **much more difficult** to solve using channels.
